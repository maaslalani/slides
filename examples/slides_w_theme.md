}
```

# h1
## h2
### h3

# Markdown components
You can use everything in markdown!
* Like bulleted list
* You know the deal

1. Numbered lists too

| Tables | Too    |
| ------ | ------ |
| Even   | Tables |

All you need to do is separate slides with triple dashes `---` on a separate line,
like so:

```markdown
# Slide 1
Some stuff

--- 

# Slide 2
Some other stuff
```
