# Welcome to Slides
A terminal based presentation tool

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Written in Go!")
}
```

## Everything is markdown
In fact this entire presentation is a markdown file

---

# h1
## h2
### h3
#### h4
##### h5
###### h6

# Markdown components
You can use everything in markdown!
* Like bulleted list
* You know the deal

1. Numbered lists too

| Tables | Too    |
| ------ | ------ |
| Even   | Tables |

---

All you need to do is separate slides with triple dashes `---` on a separate line,
like so:

```markdown
# Slide 1
Some stuff

--- 

# Slide 2
Some other stuff
```
